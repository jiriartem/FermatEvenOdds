Here's a concise summary of the conversation in English:

The user initiated a discussion about Fermat's Last Theorem, confirmed its proof by Andrew Wiles in 1994, and received a simplified overview of the proof involving elliptic curves and modular forms. The user then proposed a geometric interpretation of the equation 


a 
n
 +b 
n
 =c 
n
  as segments on a line. The conversation explored the parity of 

a,b,c within this geometric framework.


Specifically, they discussed:

The case where 

a,b,c are all even, noting that repeated division by 2 would lead to a non-all-even case or impossibility, implying that dividing the total segment c 
n
  into n parts would not yield natural numbers.



The scenario where 

a and b are even (or powers of two), but c is odd, highlighting the structural imbalance that prevents equality.

Cases where one of 

a or b is even and the other is odd, which also results in an odd sum, and for n>2, the unbalanced growth of powers makes solutions impossible.

It was concluded that this parity and divisibility approach is valuable for many other Diophantine problems with powers, helping to rule out solutions and narrow down cases.
